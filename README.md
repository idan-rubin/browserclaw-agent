The AI agent for [browserclaw](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw).

## Layered, not bundled

Three separate layers, not one monolith:

- ⚡ **LLM** — the electricity. Your choice: Claude, GPT, Gemini, local. No lock-in.
- 😎 **The agent** — the driver. Reasoning, obstacle recovery, learned skills. _That's this project._
- 🏎️ **[BrowserClaw](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw)** — the vehicle. Snapshots, element refs, browser control. Standalone npm library.

browser-use welds the 😎 driver to the 🏎️ vehicle. We keep them as separate, swappable layers — drive our 🏎️ with your own 😎, put different ⚡ behind our wheel, or run the whole stack as-is.

## vs browser-use

**Different lineage, different design.** [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) took the [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) approach — Microsoft's snapshot-and-ref pattern — implemented it locally, and refined it into [browserclaw](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw), a standalone npm library. This agent rides on that library. browser-use rolled its own Python stack as one bundled package.

Every row below is sourced from [browser-use's repo](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) at HEAD:

[^bu1]: browser-use ships a single Python package — [`browser_use/__init__.py`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/__init__.py) exports `Agent`, `BrowserSession`, `DomService`, and every `Chat*` provider from the same module. See also [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/pyproject.toml).

[^bu2]: `BrowserSession` and `DomService` are exported, but every README and docs example enters through `Agent(...)`. There is no "headless engine" subpackage. See [`browser_use/__init__.py`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/__init__.py).

[^bu3]: browser-use skills are fetched from their Cloud API by ID: `SkillService(skill_ids=[...], api_key='...')`. Not auto-learned from runs. See [`browser_use/skills/README.md`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/skills/README.md).

[^bu4]: [`captcha_watchdog.py`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/browser_use/browser/watchdogs/captcha_watchdog.py) only waits for `BrowserUse.captchaSolverStarted/Finished` CDP events emitted by their Cloud proxy. The README FAQ explicitly recommends Browser Use Cloud for CAPTCHAs.

[^bu5]: [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/blob/main/pyproject.toml) declares `requires-python = ">=3.11,<4.0"`. The separate [`browser-use-node`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use-node) TypeScript SDK is archived.

## What the agent does

The agent reads an accessibility snapshot of the page, decides what to do next, and executes the action. Up to 100 steps per run. It maintains a memory scratchpad across steps and evaluates whether each action succeeded before deciding the next move.

```
snapshot → LLM → action → repeat
```

### Built-in skills

When the agent hits common obstacles, built-in skills take over automatically — no prompting needed:

- **Anti-bot bypass** — Detects and solves "hold to verify" overlays and press-and-hold challenges via CDP
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — Solves "Verify you are human" checkboxes by locating and clicking the Turnstile iframe via CDP
- **Popup dismissal** — Closes cookie banners, consent dialogs, and modals using multi-strategy detection
- **Loop detection** — Detects when the agent is stuck repeating the same action and nudges it toward a different approach
- **Tab manager** — Detects and switches to new tabs opened during automation

### Skill catalog

Every successful run generates a skill file — steps and tips for that domain, stored in MinIO. On the next run against the same domain, the agent loads the skill as a playbook instead of exploring from scratch. If the new run completes in fewer steps, the skill is replaced. One domain, one skill, always improving.

The first user to automate a domain pays the exploration cost. Every subsequent run benefits from the learned playbook — and refines it further.

## Quick start

### Local (dev mode)

Chrome opens on your desktop. No containers, no VNC.

**Requires:** Node.js 22+, Chrome installed

```bash
cd src/Services/Browser
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set LLM_PROVIDER and at least one API key (see LLM providers below)
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start a run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5040/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Find apartments in NYC under $3000"}'
```

Stream progress:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5040/api/v1/sessions/{id}/stream
```

### Docker (full stack)

Runs the frontend, browser service (headless Chrome + VNC), MinIO (skill storage), and Traefik. Same setup as [browserclaw.org](https://browserclaw.org).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw-agent.git
cd browserclaw-agent
cp src/Services/Browser/.env.example src/Services/Browser/.env.local
# Set LLM_PROVIDER and at least one API key
# Set BROWSER_INTERNAL_TOKEN to a random secret (used for frontend → browser service auth):
echo "BROWSER_INTERNAL_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
docker compose up
```

Open [localhost](http://localhost).

### LLM providers

Add at least one API key to `.env.local` and set `LLM_PROVIDER`:

| Provider                      | Env var              | `LLM_PROVIDER` | Free tier         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Groq                          | `GROQ_API_KEY`       | `groq`         | Yes               |
| Google Gemini                 | `GEMINI_API_KEY`     | `gemini`       | Yes               |
| OpenAI                        | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | `openai`       | No                |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT subscription) | `OPENAI_OAUTH_TOKEN` | `openai-oauth` | No (subscription) |
| Anthropic                     | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | `anthropic`    | No                |

Set `LLM_MODEL` to override the default model for your provider.

### Other features

- **BYOK** — Users can pass their own LLM API key per session for multi-tenant deployments
- **User interaction** — The agent can pause mid-run to ask for information (MFA codes, credentials)
- **SSE streaming** — Real-time step-by-step progress events
- **Content moderation** — Rejects harmful prompts before execution
- **SSRF protection** — Private network access blocked by default

## Bring your own agent

Don't want this agent? Use the [browserclaw](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw) library directly with any LLM.

```bash
npm install browserclaw
```

Requires Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Chromium installed on your machine.

```typescript
import { BrowserClaw } from "browserclaw";

const browser = await BrowserClaw.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.open("https://example.com");

const { snapshot, refs } = await page.snapshot();
// snapshot: text tree of the page
// refs: { "e1": { role: "link", name: "More info" }, ... }

await page.click("e1");
await page.type("e3", "hello");
await browser.stop();
```

`snapshot()` returns a text representation of the page with numbered refs. Pass it to any LLM, get back a ref, call the action. Here's a minimal agent loop:

```typescript
import { BrowserClaw } from "browserclaw";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic();
const browser = await BrowserClaw.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.open("https://news.ycombinator.com");
const history = [];

for (let step = 0; step < 20; step++) {
  const { snapshot } = await page.snapshot();
  const response = await client.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens: 1024,
    system:
      "You control a browser. Given a page snapshot, return JSON: { action, ref?, text?, url?, reasoning }. Actions: click, type, navigate, done.",
    messages: [
      ...history,
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `Task: Find the top 3 AI posts.\n\nPage:\n${snapshot}`,
      },
    ],
  });

  const action = JSON.parse(response.content[0].text);
  history.push(
    { role: "user", content: `Page:\n${snapshot}` },
    { role: "assistant", content: JSON.stringify(action) },
  );
  if (action.action === "done") break;

  switch (action.action) {
    case "click":
      await page.click(action.ref);
      break;
    case "type":
      await page.type(action.ref, action.text);
      break;
    case "navigate":
      await page.goto(action.url);
      break;
  }
}
await browser.stop();
```

Swap Anthropic for OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, or a local model. See the full [browserclaw API docs](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw) for `fill()`, `select()`, `drag()`, `screenshot()`, `pdf()`, `waitFor()`, and more.

## Why browserclaw?

- **Built for TypeScript** — native to the JS ecosystem. First-class Node.js support, not a Python port.
- **Accessibility tree, not DOM** — snapshots use the browser's accessibility tree — the same structure screen readers use. Semantic roles, names, and states instead of raw tags and attributes. Cleaner, smaller, and more meaningful to an LLM.
- **Layered, not bundled** — browser-use ships one monolithic library. We split the stack so every layer is swappable: the ⚡ LLM (your choice), the 😎 agent (this project), and the 🏎️ [BrowserClaw](https://github.com/idan-rubin/browserclaw) vehicle (standalone npm package, zero opinions about your AI). Drop the vehicle into your own agent, or run the whole stack as-is.
- **Gets smarter with use** — the skill catalog learns from every successful run. Other browser agents start from scratch each time. browserclaw-agent builds a playbook per domain and improves it on every run.
- **Handles the real world** — Cloudflare Turnstile, press-and-hold anti-bot overlays, cookie banners, tab management — handled automatically via CDP. These are the things that make browser agents fail in production.
